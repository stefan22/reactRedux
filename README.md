# reactRedux

+ Higher order Components [HOC] &nbsp; :boom:
   - passing a component as an argument in another function component
   - spread object operator for passing props

+ React-redux &nbsp; :boom:
   - to `access` ***store information*** from react components
   - `no longer have clear` ***tree structure*** to pass stuff between like i
     did before.
   - `passing things down` to components that needs them, ***don't make*** much
     ***sense*** here as i'm getting way in too deep; especially now that I'm
     `passing a ton of props` ***between components***....and that would not be
     re-usable. &nbsp; :ok_hand:

   - from redux getting: a ***provider component*** and a ***connect component***
